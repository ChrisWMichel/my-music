        <p class="mt-8 text-lg font-medium text-gray-300 text-pretty sm:text-xl/8">
          First off, this app is currently a work in progress. It is a music app that allows you to
          listen to music and comment on songs. It is built with Vue 3 and Tailwind CSS. The app
          uses Firebase for authentication and Firestore for the database. The app is styled with
          Tailwind CSS and uses the FontAwesome icon library.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg font-medium text-gray-300 text-pretty sm:text-xl/8">
        I would encourage you to register and login to the app so that you can appreciate the full
        functionality this app has to offer (you don't need to user your real name or email). You
        can listen to music and comment on songs. You can also view the comments that other users
        have made on the songs. The app is a great way to discover new music and share your thoughts
        with others.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8 text-lg font-medium text-gray-300 text-pretty sm:text-xl/8">
        For the programmers out there that want to view the code, you can view the code on my GitHub
        page. The code is open source and you are free to use it as you see fit. I hope you enjoy
        the app and find it useful. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to
        contact me.
